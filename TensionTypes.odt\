Different Types of Tension

Generally tension can be meastension. ured by an unduly high heart rate and high blood pressuer (These do have a correlation and a logical relation=> rapid heart rate is required to pump blood when the blood vessels are partially blocked.  They also occur when exercizing, where high heart rate is expected.

Now we get a clue to different types of tension: One that can be understood, and one that is not easily understood. The one that is difficult to understood, causes the brain to work in circles attempting to understanding, and that is mental tension. The one that is understood (i.e. the exercise) causes very little mental tension.

Why should the brain run-around in circles when it cannot understand? The reason to reduce tension. When something cannot be understood, every aspect of what occurred is stored. This is the natural mechanism of learning, and adapting and preparing for action in case it occurs again. This amount of memory requires a log of energy, which we call running-around, and the brain is tense. To deal with this, it attempts to 'understand', which is finding a rule to eliminate extraneous information.  Once that is found, extraneous information is discarded and memory required is reduced, resulting in lessening of 'tension'.

Sigmund Freud has alluded to this in his book 'Civilization and its discontents' wherein he describes one of the main motives of living beings is 'avoidance of pain'.  The brain is 'pained' by its heavy load, and 'undestanding' is way of minimizing that load while keeping track of essential information.

Yoga alludes to this and describes ways to reduce tension...'observe the results, yet not get attached to it' is an exhortation to examine the results and find the reasons with no emotion involved. This is a key to understanding, and as reasoning succeeds, tension reduces. Yoga also recognizes that many problems are not understandable, and provides techniques of reducing the memory to retain them, by asking for 'acceptance' rather than spending efforts in finding the reasons.
